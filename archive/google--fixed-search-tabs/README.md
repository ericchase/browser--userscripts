# google--fixed-search-tabs
This script lets the user define a tab order for Google Search's tabbar.

The 'tabbar' is that horizontal list of pages that allow you to search different things.
It usually goes like this:
  All   Images    Videos    News    Maps    More
  
If you've ever wanted the pages to stay in the same order no matter what you search for, now it is possible.


Feel free to modify the code to your liking.<br>
