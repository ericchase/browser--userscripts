# userscripts
This repo will house any userscripts that I myself have made and work on.

I use Chrome and Firefox. These scripts should work in both [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) and [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/).

Use these userscripts and feel free to share them.<br/>
If improvements can be made, submit an issue!<br/>
Thanks<br/>
